import java.util.*;
public class One {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
		System.out.println("Enter the no of students placed in CSE: ");
		int c=sc.nextInt();
		System.out.println("Enter the no of students placed in ECE: ");
		int e=sc.nextInt();
		System.out.println("Enter the no of students placed in MECH: ");
		int m=sc.nextInt();
		if(c<0 || e<0 || m<0) {
			System.out.println("Invalid Input");
		}
		else if(c==e && e==m) {
			System.out.println("None of the department has got the highest placement");
			
		}
		else {
			int max=Math.max(Math.max(e, m),c);
			
			System.out.println("Highest Placement : ");
			if(max==c) {
				System.out.println("CSE");
			}
			if(max==e) {

			}
